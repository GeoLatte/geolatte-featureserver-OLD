<h1>Welcome to GeoLatte Featureserver</h1>

Welcome. This frontpage indicates that the GeoLatte featureserver servlet was succesfully deployed.
<p>
FeatureServer is a generic Hibernate(spatial) based server that allows one to quickly serve geometric features
 through a rest-based api, with minimal effort in configuration: just name the database you wish to serve, and off you go!

For more information regarding featureserver and its modus operandi, please visit the <a href="http://www.geolatte.org">GeoLatte</a> homepage.
