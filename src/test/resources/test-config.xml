            <!-- A table is included if a rule is present for its inclusion and no rule is present for its exclusion
                 Both the Include and the Exclude set are processes in order, and as soon as rule is hit, the rest of the
                 rules are skipped. If an item matches both an includes and an excludes set, it is therefore NOT included.
                 * is supported as a wildcard on names.
                 Suppose you include TBL_* and VIEW_*, and you exclude *Test, then the tables TBL_data, and VIEW_PERSONS
                 will be included, but OTHER and TBL_ViewTest will not.
                 Note that only '*' is accepted as a wildcardcharacter.
